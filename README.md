# Meetup # 18: Lightning Talks  

The format we followed was a roundtable discussion, fueled from a few lightning talks. 

Lightning Talks included: 
- Browser Hygiene
- Sysadmin War Stories I: HTTP Slow Attack 
- Is Slack Good for you?
- Sysadmin War Stories II: Root of All Evil
- Terraform: An Approach to Infrastructure as Code
- Your designer loves Sketch â€¦and you should too!
- From 0 to Jekyll in less than a weekend
- ~~NVIDIA Docker: GPU Server Application Deployment~~

The roundtable started with a vote on the topic to discuss and continued with an ~1h discussion. We just kept it to one topic, didn't feel like changing.
